The Property Analysis project aims to explore various data management and reporting tools to gain insights into real estate trends.
This project will involve working with both internal data stored in a data warehouse and open data provided by the Australian government. 
It will help to develop skills in data analysis and visualization, 
as well as provide a deeper understanding of the real estate market and the factors that drive it, further informing decision-making processes.
